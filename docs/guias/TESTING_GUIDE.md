- [ ] Multiple faces in camera (depends on backend logic)
- [ ] Poor lighting conditions
- [ ] Different angles/expressions from registration
- [ ] Unknown person (should not recognize)

### Validation Edge Cases

- [ ] Multiple entries/exits in same day

### Data Integrity

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **SSL Warning**: LibreSSL warning in backend (doesn't affect functionality)
2. **Camera Access**: Requires HTTPS in production (localhost works with HTTP)
3. **Single Face**: System processes one face at a time
4. **Photo Quality**: Best results with clear, well-lit photos
5. **Professor ID**: Currently hardcoded as 1 for validation (can be improved)

---

##  Success Criteria

All integrations are successful if:
1.  All CRUD operations work (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2.  Face recognition correctly identifies registered students
3.  Entry/exit logic works automatically
4.  Professor validation workflow functions
5.  All admin features accessible and functional
6.  No console errors or broken API calls
7.  Data persists correctly in database
8.  UI provides clear feedback for all actions

## 🚨 If Something Fails

1. **Check Backend Logs**: Terminal running backend
2. **Check Frontend Console**: Browser DevTools (F12)
3. **Verify API Response**: Use browser Network tab
4. **Check Database**: Supabase dashboard
5. **Restart Servers**: If needed, stop and restart both
6. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes needed for JS changes
